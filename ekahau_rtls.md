HOW

運作原理: RFID-over-Wi-Fi™ Ekahau TS-c "Cube" Temperature Tag with Integrated Sensor

First:

Ekahau’s real-time location tracking uses small, long-lasting, battery-powered Wi-Fi tags are attached to the tracked assets, refrigeration units or carried by staff.

Signal measurements are taken from the radio communication and delivered to the Vision™ RTLS software controller, along with other information such as button presses, battery information and temperature measurements. Wi-Fi Tags and Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) communicate using standard 802.11 communications
Second:

Ekahau Vision™ RTLS location engine uses patented location “fingerprinting” to accurat****ely predict and display real-time asset and staff locations.

Received Signal Strength Measurements (RSSI) are transformed into accurate locations using patented RFID-over-Wi-Fi technology used by Ekahau RTLS.

Ekahau Vision™, our web-based analytics platform establishes and processes the rules, messages and environmental data from tags and turns raw location data into dynamic maps, event-based alerts, 2-way communications, advanced reports and dashboards.
