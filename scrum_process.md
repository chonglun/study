Effective scrum teams are **self-organizing** : Each person is committed to the project's goals. *(commit to things they believe in and not commit to ideas, actions or policies they do not believe in.)*

Scrum team are **openness** : everyone else on the team should always be aware of what you’re working on and how it moves the project towards its current goals.

    + 承諾衝刺的目標 _Commit to Sprint Goals_
2. **個人的承諾@Daily Scrum** : 驅動彼此前進的重要力量
